# Media Insights Application

## Overview
The Media Insights application is built to process and analyze audio and video files efficiently. It leverages advanced technologies like Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text for transcriptions, OpenAI's GPT models for summarization, and Spacy for text enhancement. This tool is designed to provide deep insights into media content, making it invaluable for content creators, marketers, and researchers.

## Key Features
- **Audio Splitting:** Breaks down large audio files into smaller chunks for more efficient processing.
- **Transcription:** Converts spoken language into written text using Google Cloudâ€™s Speech-to-Text service.
- **Text Enhancement:** Enhances the readability and structure of transcripts using Spacy.
- **Summary Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate concise summaries of the transcribed text.
- **Embedding Generation:** Generates text embeddings for advanced data analysis and machine learning applications.
- **Database Integration:** Stores all processed data efficiently in a SingleStore database.
